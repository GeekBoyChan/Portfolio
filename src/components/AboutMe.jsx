          Hello! My name is Chandler Ocapan. At a young age I was fascinated
          with the show Battle Bots. On my first college campus tour in high
          school, I saw the Computer Engineering students showcasing remote
          controlled robots that they had made for one of their classes. From
          that moment, I decided to pursue a degree in Computer Engineering.

          Fast-forward to present day, I have a bachelor's degree in Computer
          Engineering and have further devloped my coding by completing a
          Software Engineering immersive. I'm now looking to further develop my
          skills as a professional Software Engineer.
